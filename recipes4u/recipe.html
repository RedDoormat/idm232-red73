                Weʼre amping up chicken breasts with a glaze of smoky ancho chile paste and fresh orange juice 
                in this recipe. On the side, roasted carrots and lightly creamy, golden raisin-studded rice 
                perfectly accent the sweetness of the glaze.

            <h2>Let's begin cooking!</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18594_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Rice in a pot on a stove.">
            </div>
            <p>
                Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. In a medium pot, combine 
                the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, 
                cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed 
                and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18622_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Ingredients for glaze">
            </div>
            <p>
                While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, 
                then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the 
                kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; 
                mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the 
                orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste 
                and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.
            </p>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18626_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Carrots in a tray">
            </div>
            <p>
                Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and 
                pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when 
                pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18609_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Kale in a pan on stove">
            </div>
            <p>
                While the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of 
                olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 
                seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; 
                season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale 
                has wilted and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice. Stir to combine; 
                season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18639_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Glazed chicken being cooked on stove">
            </div>
            <p>
                While the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt 
                and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until 
                hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. 
                Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently 
                spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked 
                through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until 
                the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </p>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <div class="step_img">
                <img src="../assets/images/Recipe_Ancho-Orange_Chicken_with_Kale_Rice_Roasted_Carrots/0101_FPP_Chicken-Rice_18630_WEB_high_feature.jpg" alt="Rice and kale being stirred in a pot">
            </div>
            <p>
                To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, crème fraîche, raisins, and the juice 
                of the remaining lime half. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the 
                glazed chicken with the finished rice and roasted carrots. Top the chicken with the remaining 
                glaze from the pan. Enjoy!
